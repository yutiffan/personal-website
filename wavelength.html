                <p>For the final project of my software development course, my team and I created a dating app based on music taste. 
                    I was responsible for the idea, as well as developing the entire front end of the app. We built a CRUD app using 
                    React js, Material UI, and Axios for front end and Postgres (database) and spring boot for backend. </p>

                <p>We were able to complete the app but only on a basic level. You can learn more about our final project by looking 
                    at our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlZKbUDcHrY">demo video</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jhjullie/wavelength">Github repository</a>.</p>

                <p>Since I was in charge of designing and developing the front end, I wanted to continue building out the web app 
                    further and try out different back end frameworks. I saw this as an opportunity to learn more frameworks and 
                    try building out the app as a full-stack engineer. </p>

            <div class = "contentcontainer bodytext" id = "titletext">
                <p>Wavelength is a web app that matches people based on their music tastes. Since human connections are built upon 
                    shared interests and music is one that many share, we hope to foster more meaningful connections through an 
                    algorithm based on music choices to find friends and concert buddies. This web app will be made for people who 
                    love listening to music and meeting people with similar music tastes - essentially an app to connect people on 
                    the same <i>wavelength</i>. </p>
                <p>Upon creating an account, users will be asked to create a profile with their name, age, and music genre. A user's 
                    profile will be available to people once they are matched with one another. To discover matches, users will “swipe” 
                    either yes or no based on a short summary of another person's music tastes.</p>

            <div class = "contentcontainer bodytext" id = "titletext">
                <p>For front end, I used Figma to create the UI/UX designs and React to build the actual app. For back end, 
                    I used Firebase realtime database to store the users. I decided to use Firebase instead of Postgres because 
                    the data would not be limited to local usage. Moreover, Firebase would allow me to easily deploy the app to the web.</p>

                <p>Beginning with ideation, I sketched out simple wire frames for the main pages and its transitions. 
                    After deciding on our main pages, we began creating the pages and prototyping. It was my first time 
                    creating prototypes on Figma but I was able to quickly get the hang of it.  </p>

                <p>We planned to build the app using Flutter, but we ran into problems as this was our first time using Flutter. 
                    We were able to build out the main page but we were ultimately unable to connect the camera feature and other 
                    pages due to the time constraint. Our Github repo can be found <a href="https://github.com/aaronwong25/trood" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
