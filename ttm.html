            <div class = "contentcontainer bodytext" id = "titletext">
                <p>During the gap semester of my sophomore year, I had the pleasure to intern at <a href = "https://www.ttmask.com/" target="_blank">Timeless Truth Mask</a>, 
                a Taiwan-based skincare company specializing in facial sheet masks, in their sales and marketing department. 
                I was primarily working with international clients and building its international brand awareness. I also 
                worked with their laboratory called <a href = "https://jolab.jolacare.com/" target="_blank">Jolab</a>, a research and development laboratory that manufactures skincare 
                products. To aid its OEM clients on the types of products they should manufacture, I created personalized 
                presentations with recommendations using data and market insights.</p>
                <p>
                During my 6-month internship, I learned a lot of different skills and faced numerous challenges. 
                These challenges can be summed into one main problem that I tackled with various solutions during my internship.

                    manager, Momo, with additional questions. Lastly, I toured their laboratory, Jolab, to gain a better 
                    understanding on their equipment and manufacturing processes.</p>

                <p>This was one of the first few assignments tasked to me as an intern. They mentioned 
                    how they would send over 500+ emails with 0 responses back. I wanted to improve this 
                    response rate so I decided to take on a different approach by doing research and creating 
                    more personalized emails. In the opening paragraph, I would mention specific facts that 
                    pertain to them and how their values aligned with TTM's. By drawing out the connection, 
                    they are more likely to want to collaborate on a project. Instead of quantity, I decided 
                    to prioritize quality.</p>

                <p>By doing so, I was able to increase the response rate by 60% by the first week. After sharing it to my 
                    co-workers, this approach was adapted into a Chinese version. Using the Chinese template, my co-worker 
                    found that 2/3 of the influencers she messaged had replied.</p>

                <p>After looking through their brand and products training slide deck of more than 70 pages, I realized 
                    that it may be hard for distributors to quickly comprehend the differences between the 7 product lines. 
                    I wanted to help distributors easily identify unique selling points for each product line. Therefore I 
                    decided to add a recap slide after each product line to outline the key selling points. By doing so, it 
                    will help distributors better understand the differences between TTM's products and further aid them in 
                    promoting our products in their respective country. </p>

                <p>To practice presenting in front of international distributors, I practiced numerous times alone and with my 
                    manager. I also recorded myself presenting to see ways I could improve. Moreover, I anticipated questions 
                    the distributors may have so I could better respond to them after the presentation. </p>

                <p>By adding a summary page after each product line, the entire presentation was easier to comprehend and more streamlined. 
                    This was evident in our presentation to the distributors in Czech Republic. They commented on how the summary slides 
                    were a good way to identify key takeaways for each product lines. </p>
